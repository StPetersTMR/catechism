              <h2>What is a Catechism?</h2>
              <p>A catechism is a <em><strong>summary</strong></em> or <em><strong>overview</strong></em>
                of core beliefs, practices, and commitments of Christian faith;
                its <em><strong>purpose</strong></em> is to teach these core elements in a format that is easily remembered.</p>
              <p>In the Early Church (the first several centuries after
                Jesus&#39; life), learning the local catechism was a
                requirement for baptism and catechism classes
                normally lasted for three years!</p> 
              <p>Today, however, catechism may come before or after
                baptism. Indeed, it can be done at any stage of
                one&#39;s journey of faith, whether as a new believer or
                as a long-term believer.</p>
              <p>The purpose of a catechism is not simply to pass
                along knowledge and tradition for its own sake, but
                rather to pass these along <em>in order to shape how we
                live</em> -- in our daily lives and in our modern world.
                Therefore the later stages of the Online Catechism
                are designed to stimulate constructive thinking about
                how to live this faith today, in response to the sorts of
                pressures, questions, and issues that followers of
                Jesus face in today&#39;s world.</p>

            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="3">
              <h2>How is a Catechism different from Sunday School?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Sunday School begins in early childhood, while catechisms
                  are usually intended for adolescents and adults</li>
                <li>Sunday School curricula often focus on learning scripture,
                  while catechisms introduce material from church tradition,
                  church history, and denominational identity.</li>
                <li>Sunday School attendance can be inconsistent, since
                  participants might not be present every Sunday, so material
                  can be easily missed; however, this catechism is designed
                  for participants to do at their own pace, thus ensuring that
                  all the material is covered.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="4">
              <h2>How is this Catechism different from other Catechisms?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Traditional catechisms convey information that is to be
                  learned, often through a Question &amp; Answer format; however,
                  this approach can tend to focus on simply &#39;regurgitating&#39; the
                  material.</li>
                <li>In contrast, the Online Catechism is structured in stages to
                  provide a process that does not simply regurgitate the material
                  but rather forms a Christian mind (how to think &#39;Christianly&#39;
                  about matters today), and forms discipleship for life today. </li>
                <li>Participants proceed at their own pace. This allows the material
                  to be absorbed, discussed, and processed at a pace that works
                  for the participants.</li>
              </ul>

            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="5">
              <h2>How to Use this Catechism</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>The Online Catechism is especially useful for situations in
                  which a traditional catechism class at church will not work,
                  such as in &#39;commuter&#39; churches.</li>
                <li>It can be used by individuals, families, or groups.</li>
                <li>In a family, parents and children can take turns reading the
                  text aloud, and can raise questions or discuss the topic at a
                  pace that works for them.</li>
                <li>Adult groups may wish to use this Catechism while
                  meeting by Skype<sup>TM</sup> or Google Hangouts<sup>TM</sup>.</li>
                <li>Participating in a catechism, including the Online
                  Catechism, does require of participants a sustained
                  commitment of time and effort.</li>
                <li>Participants are encouraged to use some writing
                  method (such as a pen and notebook, or a tablet) to
                  record questions for discussion, or to record
                  thoughts and insights for future reference.</li>
                <li>Periodically, you may wish to arrange discussions
                  with your Pastor about questions that arise.</i>

              <p>The Online Catechism proceeds in six stages, to do at

              <ul>
                <li>Stages One and Two are recommended for <em>ages 13
                  and up</em>. These stages are particularly appropriate for
                  families to do together.</li>
                <li>Subsequent stages are recommended for ages <em>16
                  and up</em>.</li>
                <li>Pastors and teachers should feel free to modify this
                  material, or add their own supplementary material,
                  as they think necessary for their context or
                  congregation</li>
                <li>As a mark of completing Stage One, or indeed any of
                  the other stages, participants may wish to make a
                  public profession of faith before their community of
                  worship or in their Sunday School class.</li>
                <li>Of those who chose to make such a public profession,
                  for some this will be their first time doing so; for
                  others it might not be their first time, in which case
                  such a profession can serve as a sign of renewed faith.</li>

              <h2>Stages Three to Six</h2>
              <p>Some comment is needed before we proceed to the next
                stages. Stages One and Two sought to familiarize
                participants with some foundational material for
                Christian faith -- to provide a basic understanding of
                faith, discipleship, and the biblical story. Stages Three to
                Six now shift the learning process to involve deeper
                understanding, and also involve individual research
                (such as using the internet) to engage with the material.</p>
            </div>
            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="11">
              <h2>Stage Three: <small>A Deeper Understanding of Core Beliefs</small></h2>
              <p>Stage Three enables a deeper understanding of the core
                ideas of Christian faith. To do this, we will use the
                Catechism of the Presbyterian Church of Canada. Now
                you may think, "What? We will use a catechism within a
                catechism? That seems odd!" The Presbyterian
                catechism, however, is structured quite differently from
                the Online Catechism -- it provides a structure which
                gives opportunity for deeper insight into, and discussion
                of, a range of themes (or &#39;doctrines&#39;) of Christian faith.</p>
              <p>In particular, these are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>God</li>
                <li>God as Creator and Ruler</li>
                <li>God in Christ</li>
                <li>God the Holy Spirit</li>
                <li>The Bible</li>
                <li>Faith</li>
                <li>The Church (including ministry, baptism, and communion)</li>
                <li>Our Life in Christ</li>
                <li>The Church Reaches Out</li>
                <li>Our Hope in God</li>
              </ol>

            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="12">
              <h2>Stage Four: <small>Church History</small></h2>
              <p>Our current beliefs and practices do not come to us purely from scripture, but
                are mediated through history. So in this section we learn from, and are
                inspired by, the history of the Church over the past 2000 years.</p>
              <h3>Section A: <small>Themes</small></h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The Spread of Christianity I: Asia and Africa</li>
                <li>The Spread of Christianity II: Europe and the Americas</li>
                <li>The Protestant Reformation</li>
                <li>The Challenge of Modernity</li>
                <li>The Modern Missions Movement</li>
                <li>The Church and Social Care</li>
                <li>The Church Under Persecution</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Section B: <small>Personal Research</small></h3>
              <p>In this section you will gain familiarity with five significant figures from
                Christian history. Choose at least one figure from each of the following
                categories, and choose five figures in total: for each, write a half-page pointform
                summary of their life and their significance for Christian history, using
                the internet, books, videos, or resources from your Pastor.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Significant Figures in Mission History</li>
                <li>Important Thinkers in Christian History</li>
                <li>Inspiring Figures in Christian History</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For this section, you may already know figures you would like to investigate.
                If not, suggestions are provided on the website for this Stage. Your Pastor will
                also be able to provide suggestions.</p>

              <h2>Stage Five: <small>Denominational History and Distinctives</small></h2>
              <p>The process of working through a catechesis always takes place
                within the context of a Christian community and tradition, with
                the lenses on Christian faith that come with that
                denominational context. This stage introduces participants to
                the history, thought, and practices of their home denomination
                or tradition. Individual pastors will either use denominational
                resources already available or develop their own resources for
                this stage.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>On the next slide are a number of topics. Participants will
                  choose five of these topics, and for each topic will invest at
                  least four hours of learning about that topic. This may be
                  done by reading a book, reading magazine or journal
                  articles, researching on the internet, and/or watching
                  videos. Your Pastor can help you find relevant resources.</li>
                <li>Although participants may be inclined to focus on less than
                  five topics, the reason for exploring five topics is that such
                  breadth of exposure is intended to develop patterns of
                  Christianly thinking across a range of issues about how to
                  live daily life, and how to engage with issues in our modern
                  and post-modern world.</li>

                <li>Completing all six stages is a significant personal
                  achievement, demonstrating substantial commitment,
                  perseverance, and personal growth. It would be
                  appropriate for Pastors and congregations to find a
                  significant way to mark this accomplishment when a
                  church-member completes all six stages.</li>
